# Strings

- Two commonly used types of strings:
    1. String - owned
    2. &str - borrowed String slice
- Must use an owned string to store in a struct
- Use &str when passing to a function


## Example -- pass to a function

```rust
    fn print_it(data: &str){
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }

    fn main() {
        print_it("Hello World!");
        let owned_string = "Owned string".to_owned();
        let another_owned_string = String::from("Another owned string");
        print_it(&owned_string);
        print_it(&another_owned_string);
    }
```

- `print_it` takes a borrowed string slice
- The first call `print_it("Hello World!");` automatically borrows the string slice
- There are two ways to create an owned string
    1. `to_owned()` method
    2. `String::from()` function
- To use the owned string in the function, we need to borrow it:
    - `print_it(&owned_string);`
    - `print_it(&another_owned_string);`

## Example of what won't work!

``` rust
struct Employee {
    name: &str,
}

fn main() {
    let employee = Employee {
        name: "John Doe",
    };
}
```
- The above won't work. We can't store a string slice within a `struct`!
- When we create a string like this, it is automatically borrowed. If we try to store borrowed data in a struct, it won't work. When the structure is dropped, it is responsible for cleaning up it's own memory. But we have borrowed memory in the struct, meaning that it is not allowed to clean up the memory. This is why we can't store borrowed data in a struct.

## Example of what will work!

```rust
struct Employee {
    name: String,
}

fn main() {
    let employee = Employee {
        name: "John Doe".to_owned(),
    };
}
```

- The owned data is transferred to the struct, meaning that we transfer the ownership of the data to the struct. The struct is now responsible for cleaning up the memory. This is why we can store owned data in a struct.

# Structure

- A type that contains multiple pieces of data
    - All or nothing - cannot have some pieces of data and not others
- Each piece of data is called a "field"
- Makes working with data easier
    - Similar data can be grouped together

## Example

``` rust
struct ShippingBox {
    depth: i32,
    width: i32,
    height: i32,
}

let my_box = ShippingBox {
    depth: 10,
    width: 10,
    height: 10,
};

let tall = my_box.height;
println!("The box is {} tall", tall);

```

- The `ShippingBox` type contains three fields: `depth`, `width`, and `height`
- The `my_box` variable is an instance of the `ShippingBox` type

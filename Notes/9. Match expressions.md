# Match expressions
- Add logic to your program
- Similar to if..else
- Exhaustive: All options must be accounted for

``` rust
fn main() {
    let some_bool = true;
    match some_bool {
        true => println!("It's true!"),
        false => println!("It's false!"),
    }
}

```

- Must list out all the possible options it will have
- The condition must be lister with the fat arrow `=>`
- At the end we use a comma. It uses ends expressions, not statements.

``` rust
fn main() {
    let some_int = 3;
    match some_int {
        1 => println!("It's one!"),
        2 => println!("It's two!"),
        3 => println!("It's three!"),
        _ => println!("It's something else!"),
    }
}
```
- We can list out every possible combination
- The underscore `_` is a catch all

## Match vs else..if
- match will be checked by the compiler
    - If a new possibility is added, you will be notified when this occurs
- else..if is not checked by the compiler
    - If a new possibility is added, your code may contain a bug

You might want to have the compiler on your side...
- Prefer match over else..if when working with a single variable
- match considers all possibilities


# Advance match

In the past, we used the "_" as a catch all. Well, we can actually give the catch all a variable name and then use it

``` rust
fn main() {
    let n = 3;
    match n { 
        3 => println!("It's three!"),
        other => println!("It's something else: {}", other),
    }
}

```

Using this logic, we can help to match on enums!

``` rust
enum Discount {
    Percent(i32),
    Flat(i32),
}
fn main () {
    let flat = Discount::Flat(10);
    match flat {
        Discount::Flat(10) => println!("It's ten!"),
        Discount::Flat(amount) => println!("It's something else: {}", amount),
        _ => (), // Return nothing
    }
}
```

We can also match on a struct

``` rust
struct Ticket {
    event: String,
    price: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let concert = Ticket {
        event: "concert".to_string(),
        price: 50,
    };
    match concert {
        Ticket { price, .. } => println!("Ticket costs {} bucks!", price),
        Ticket { price: 75, .. } => println!("Ticket costs 75 bucks!"),
        Ticket { price, event } => println!("Ticket costs {} bucks for the {}!", price, event),
        _ => (),
    }
}
```
- We're only concerned on the price, so we use the `..` to ignore the event

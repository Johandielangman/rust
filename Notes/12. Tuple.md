# Tuples

- Type of record
- Store data anonymously
    - No field names
- Useful to return pairs of data from functions
- Can be "destructed" easily into variables

## Example

``` rust
enum Access {
    Full,
}

fn one_two_three() -> (i32, i32, i32) {
    (1, 2, 3)
}

let numbers = one_two_three();
let (x, y, z) one_two_three();

println!("{:?} {:?}", x, numbers.0);
println!("{:?} {:?}", y, numbers.1);
println!("{:?} {:?}", z, numbers.2);

let (employee, access) = ("John", Access::Full);

```

- We have an enumeration called `Access` with a single variant called `Full`
- We have a function called `one_two_three` that returns a tuple of three `i32` values
- It's a tuple because it's a comma-separated list of values surrounded by parentheses
- We have destructuring assignment
    - The `numbers` variable is assigned the return value of `one_two_three`
    - The `x`, `y`, and `z` variables are assigned the values of the tuple
- We can access the values of the tuple using dot notation with the index of the value we want
    - `numbers.0` is the first value in the tuple
    - `numbers.1` is the second value in the tuple
    - `numbers.2` is the third value in the tuple
- We can also destructure the tuple into variables
    - The `employee` variable is assigned the first value in the tuple
    - The `access` variable is assigned the second value in the tuple

# 3. Functions

## What are functions?

- A way to encapsulate program functionality
- Optionally accept data
- Optionally return data
- Utilized for code organization
    - Also makes code easier to read

## Anatomy of a function

``` rust

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```

- The `fn` is the keyword to begin a new function
- `add` is the name of the function. It can't be an existing keyword
- `a` and `b` are the parameters of the function
    - The colon `:` is used to specify the type of the parameter. Can be what you made or what's part of the language.
    - `i32` is the type of the parameters
- The return type is specified after the `->` arrow
- The body of the function is wrapped in curly braces `{}`

## Using a function

``` rust
let x = add(1, 2);
let y = add(x, 3);
```

- The function is called by using its name
- The parameters are passed in the parenthesis `()`
- The return value can be assigned to a variable

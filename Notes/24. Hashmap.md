# Hashmap

- Collection that stores data as a key-value pairs
    - Data is located using the "key"
    - The data is the "value"
- Similar to definitions ina  dictionary
- Very fast to retrieve data using the key

## Example

``` rust
let mut people = HashMap::new();
people.insert("John", 32);
people.insert("Jane", 27);
people.insert("Bob", 44);

people.remove("Bob");

match people.get("John") {
    Some(age) => println!("John is {} years old", age),
    None => println!("No one found"),
}

```

## Example -- iterate

``` rust
for (person, age) in people.iter() {
    println!("{} is {} years old", person, age);
}

//just the keys
for person in people.keys() {
    println!("{person}");
}

//just the values
for age in people.values() {
    println!("{age}");
}
```
```

# Expressions

- Rust is an expression-based language
    - Most things are evaluated and return some value
- Expression values coalesce to a single point
    - Can be used for nesting logic

## Example

``` rust
let my_num = 3;

let is_lt_5 = if my_num < 5 {
    true
} else {
    false
};

let is_it_5 = my_num < 5;

```

- We have a variable called `my_num` that is assigned the value `3`
- We have a variable called `is_lt_5` that is assigned the result of an `if` expression
    - The `if` expression evaluates the condition `my_num < 5`
    - If the condition is true, the `if` expression returns the value `true`
    - If the condition is false, the `if` expression returns the value `false`
    - The `is_lt_5` variable is assigned the value returned by the `if` expression
- We have a variable called `is_it_5` that is assigned the result of the expression `my_num < 5`

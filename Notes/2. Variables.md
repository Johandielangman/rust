# 2. Variables

- Assign data to a temporary memory location 
    - Allows programmer to easily work with memory
- Can be set to any value & type
- Immutability by default, but can be mutable
    - Immutable: cannot be changed
    - Mutable: can be changed

``` rust

let two = 2; // Integer
let hello = "world"; // String
let j = 'j'; // Character
let my_half = 0.5; // Double
let mut my_name = "John"; // Mutable String
let quit_program = false; // Boolean
let your_half = my_half; // Copy value of my_half to your_half

```

Comments:
- The word `let` is used to declare a variable
- Variable assignments always end with a semicolon `;`
- Strings uses double quotes `""`, characters use single quotes `''`
- Use `mut` to make a variable mutable
- We can copy variables as well

Recap:
- Variables make it easier to work with data
- Variables can be assigned to any value
    - This include other variables
- Immutable by default, but can be mutable

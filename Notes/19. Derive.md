# Derive

Thus far, if we wanted to print out an enum, we would have done the following:

``` rust
enum Position {
    Manager, 
    Supervisor,
    Worker
}

struct Employee {
    position: Position,
    work_hours: i64
}

fn main () {
    let me = Employee {
        position: Position::Manager,
        work_hours: 40
    };
    match me.position {
        Position::Manager => println!("I am a manager"),
        Position::Supervisor => println!("I am a supervisor"),
        Position::Worker => println!("I am a worker")
    }
}

```

There is, however, an easier way to do this. We can use the `#[derive(Debug)]` annotation to automatically print out the enum. 

``` rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Position {
    Manager, 
    Supervisor,
    Worker
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Employee {
    position: Position,
    work_hours: i64
}

fn main () {
    let me = Employee {
        position: Position::Manager,
        work_hours: 40
    };
    println!("{:?}", me.position);
    println!("{:?}", me); // prints out the entire struct
}

```

There is also Clone and Copy.
This means we copy the data instead of moving it.

Don't abuse this. You can make expensive copies...

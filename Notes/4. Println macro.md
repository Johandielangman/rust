# PrintLn macro

## The println macro
- Macros expand into additional code
- The `println` macro "Prints" (displays) information to the terminal
- Useful for debugging

```rust
let life = 42;

println!("hello");
println!("{:?}", life);
println!("{:?} {:?}", life, life);
println!("the meaning is {:?}", life);
```

- The exclamation points indicates that we are using a macro instead of a function
- The `{:?}` indicates that we can include some external data. This is a debug print. 


We can also use variables dirtectly in the print statement:

```rust
let life = 42;
println!("{life:?}"); // For debugging
println!("{life}"); // This is for end user display
```

# Type annotations

- Required for function signatures
- Types are usually inferred
- Can also be specified in code
    - Explicit type annotations

### Example -- Basic

``` rust

fn print_many(msg: &str, count: i32) {}

enum Mouse {
    LeftClick,
    RightClick,
    MiddleClick
}

let num: i32 = 5; // Normally we don't include this, because the compiler can identify it. But it is a good idea to include it for clarity.
let a: char = 'a';

let left_click: Mouse = Mouse::LeftClick;

```

- The compiler will try it's best to infer the type of a variable. If it can't it will throw an error and ask you to specify the type.

### Example -- Generic

It is a data type that contains other data types.

``` rust
let numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let letters: Vec<char> = vec!['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
let clicks: Vec<Mouse> = vec![
    Mouse::LeftClick,
    Mouse::RightClick,
    Mouse::MiddleClick
    ];
```

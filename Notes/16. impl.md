# impl
How to implement functionality on enums and structs.
Enhances organization of code and makes it easier to follow.

## Example

Consider the code below

``` rust
struct Temperature {
    degrees_f: f64,
}

fn show_temp(temp: Temperature) {
    println!("The temperature is {} degrees F.", temp.degrees_f);
}

fn main() {
    let temp = Temperature { degrees_f: 72.0 };
    show_temp(temp);
}
```

- The `Temperature` struct is defined
- The `show_temp` function takes a `Temperature` struct as an argument
- The `main` function creates a `Temperature` struct and passes it to the `show_temp` function

## Example - impl

``` rust
struct Temperature {
    degrees_f: f64,
}

impl Temperature {
    fn show(&self) {
        println!("The temperature is {} degrees F.", self.degrees_f);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let temp = Temperature { degrees_f: 72.0 };
    temp.show();
}
```

## Example - 

``` rust
struct Temperature {
    degrees_f: f64,
}

impl Temperature {
    fn freezing() -> Self {
        Self { degrees_f: 32.0 }
    }

    fn boiling() -> Self {
        Self { degrees_f: 212.0 }
    }

    fn show(&self) {
        println!("The temperature is {} degrees F.", self.degrees_f);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let hot = Temperature { degrees_f: 72.0 };
    hot.show();

    let cold = Temperature::freezing();
    cold.show();

    let boiling = Temperature::boiling();
    boiling.show();
}
```

- The lowe case self indicates that we already have a struct created somewhere
- The uppercase Self indicates that we are creating a new struct

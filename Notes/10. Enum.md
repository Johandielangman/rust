# Enum
Working with data!
- Enum is short for enumeration
- Data that can be one of multiple different possibilities
    - Each possibility is called a variant
- Provides information about your program to the compiler
    - More robust programs

## Example

``` rust

enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}

fn which_way(direction: Direction) {
    match direction {
        Direction::Up => println!("Up"),
        Direction::Down => println!("Down"),
        Direction::Left => println!("Left"),
        Direction::Right => println!("Right"),
    }
}

```

- The direction enumeration can be one of four possibilities
- The function takes a direction enumeration as an argument
- The match expression checks the direction enumeration
    - The `::` syntax is used to access the variants
- The function prints the directions

The advantage? If we add a new direction, the compiler will tell us that we need to update the match expression!
This helps increase the robustness of our program.

# Advanced Enum

As a reminder:
- enum is a type that can represent one item at a time
    - Each item is called a variant
- enum is not limited to just plain variants
    - Each variant can optionally contain additional data

## Example

``` rust
enum Mouse {
    LeftClick,
    RightClick,
    MiddleClick,
    Scroll(i32),
    Move(i32, i32),
}
```

- Scroll has additional data associated with it
    - The number of lines to scroll
- Move has additional data associated with it
    - The x and y coordinates to move to

## Example

``` rust
enum PromoDiscount{
    NewUser,
    Holiday(String),
}

enum Discount {
    Percent(f64),
    Flat(f64),
    Promo(PromoDiscount),
    Custom(String),
}

```

- Note that Discount is an enum that contains other enums
- One thing to remember... When there is data, you always have to give it data
